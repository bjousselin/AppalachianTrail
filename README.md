# Appalachian Trail Concervancy Website

Appalachian Trail Conservancy’s website is one made out of necessity to support it’s cause. However, in today’s busy connected world, the current website does not stand out from the competition. All successful organizations these days also have an attractive, efficient and most importantly accessible website. We want to bring the ATC brand to the modern standard of design.

To achieve these goals, we will revamp both website and branding.
