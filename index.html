      <p>We seek to minimize our impact on the environment and incorporate the ideals of 
      sustainability in our everyday operations.</p>

      <h2>Maintain</h2>
      <p>We are committed to nurture and protect this sacred space through education and 
      inspiration. We strive to create an ever-expanding community of doers and dreamers, 
      and work to ensure that tomorrow’s generations will experience the same mesmerizing

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>The Appalachian Trail Conservancy upholds the highest standards for the protection 
      and management of the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) to ensure that it can be shared and 
      enjoyed well into the future.</p>

      <img src="" alt="">

      <p>Due to the Trail’s historic legacy of volunteerism, many of the ATC’s programs 
      are focused on supporting and encouraging volunteers. We work cooperatively with volunteer 
      A.T. clubs and agencies to develop meaningful Trail policies, share expertise on trail 
      design and construction, and protect the landscapes and natural and cultural resources 
      that represent the unique, inspiring, and oftentimes life changing, experience of the A.T.</p>

      <img src="" alt="">
      <img src="" alt="">

      <p>Our newer initiatives help us reach out to the next generation of A.T. supporters and 
      visitors through education and outreach programs. As we work to steward the valuable lands 
      that the A.T. traverses, we are eager to ensure those protected lands remain relevant and 
      available to all those seeking recreation and solitude on the Trail.</p>

      <h2>The trail</h2>

      <p>The Appalachian Trail is one of the longest continuously marked footpaths in the world, 
      measuring roughly 2,180 miles in length. The Trail goes through fourteen states along the 
      crests and valleys of the Appalachian mountain range from the southern terminus at Springer 
      Mountain, Georgia, to the Trail’s northern terminus at Katahdin, Maine.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The notion of a “super trail” had been a parlor topic in New England hiking-organization 
      and even academic circles for some time, but the October 1921 publication of “An Appalachian 
      Trail: A Project in Regional Planning” in the Journal of the American Institute of Architects 
      is almost universally seen as the moment of birth for the Appalachian Trail. Benton MacKaye—former 
      forester and government analyst and newspaper editor, now intermittently employed as a regional 
      planner—proposed, as a refuge from work life in industrialized metropolis, a series of work, study, 
      and farming camps along the ridges of the Appalachian Mountains, with a trail connecting them, from 
      the highest point in the North (Mt. Washington in New Hampshire) to the highest in the South (Mt. Mitchell in North Carolina). 
      Hiking was an incidental focus. MacKaye immediately set about promoting his idea within his network 
      of friends and colleagues in Washington, New York, and Boston, but it was again hikers who took up 
      the cause—newspaper columnist Raymond Torrey in New York especially, who led a small crew building 
      the rst A.T.-specic miles in Harriman–Bear Mountain State Park under the aegis of Maj. William A. Welch, 
      who soon shifted the goal to “Maine to Georgia” and designed the iconic diamond Trail marker.</p>

      <h2>Volunteer</h2>
      <p>Over 6000 volunteers contribute more than 200,000 hours each year keeping the 
      Appalachian Trail (A.T.) available for all to use. Volunteers are active in all 
      aspects of Trail work, from basic maintenance to major projects such as building 
      bridges and shelters and building new sections of the A.T.</p>

      <p>Though Trail maintainers are perhaps the most visible, volunteers also 
      participate in many other activities, from outreach to Trail management.</p>

      <h2>Appalachian Trail Community</h2>

      <p>The Appalachian Trail CommunityTM program is designed to recognize communities 
      that promote and protect the Appalachian Trail (A.T.). Towns, counties, and communities 
      along the A.T.’s corridor are considered assets by all that use the A.T. and many of 
      these towns act as good friends and neighbors to the Trail. The program serves to assist 
      communities with sustainable economic development through tourism and outdoor recreation, 
      while preserving and protecting the A.T.</p>
